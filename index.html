				<h3><u>Al's Favorite's</u></h3>
					<section>
						<a name="amsterdam"></a>
						<h4>Amterdam, Netherlands</h4>
						<p>Move beyond the surface and Amsterdam is a city where the thrill of finding new places can be more fun than visitng famous attractions. Exploring the side streets and alleys at the heart of Amsterdam can be as exhilirating a time as any. From the city's famed canals to the innumerable shops and museums that populate the city, there is so much more that Amsterdam offers than what most associate it with. Amsterdam tops my list of favorite places I've visited and is a place I hope to live someday.</p>

						<h4>Budapest, Hungary</h4>
						<p>Budapest holds a soft spot in my heart as it it the first place outside the U.S. that I traveled to. A city proud of their heritage, one of my first experiences in Budapest was at a currency exchange counter converting Euros(&#8364) to the local Forints(&#70&#116) because many shops only accept the local currency. Consisting of two parts, Buda and Pest, this is a city that has as much history as Vienna but a little less polish. Budapest is a fun city that rewards you for going off the beaten path and exploring. From The Underground and Andrássy Avenue to the banks of the Danube River that runs through the heart of the city there is so much to see and do.</p>

						<a name="vienna"></a>
						<h4>Vienna, Austria</h4>
						<p>Austria is commonly referred to as the cultural capital of Europe and for good reason. With classical or experimental theatres, film and dance festivals, operas, and many other exhibitions and concerts, Vienna is a city rife with artistic culture. Take stroll down many streets in Vienna and you will surely find one of many Viennese coffee houses boasting delicious coffee. Stop in at Demel, the former royal bakery, and and sample a Sachertorte or another one of their many offerings. End the day at a Heuriger, a local wine tavern, and experience the most recent year's wine along with local food offerings. From morning through the evening, Vienna can be thoroughly enjoyed at all times of the day.</p>

						<a name="hoorn"></a>
						<h4>Hoorn, Netherlands</h4>
						<p>Hoorn is a lake town not far from amsterdam that is located on the banks of IJsselmeer Lake. The town has a rich maritime history with ties to the East India Trading Company which has left its mark on the harbor town. The heart of the town centers around the harbor, with shops, restaurants, and houses surrounding it. Not far from Hoorn is the Afsluitdijk, an engineering wonder separating IJsselmeer lake from the North Sea. This is a comfortable, quaint town that affords a more nature-oriented experience than most other places on this list. A picturesque community, this is also a place I can envision myself living someday.</p>

						<h4>Ghent, Belgium</h4>
						<p>One of the oldest cities in Belgium, Ghent is a vibrant city. Ghent is positioned close to other cities like Antwerp and Bruges which allows it to be relatively overlooked. Because of this, visitors get a more intimate look at local life, instead of instead of having to fight through crowds of tourists. Popular stops in Ghent include the counts castle, the old harbour ,the gothic churches, and the many cafés and shops that inhabit central Ghent.</p>
